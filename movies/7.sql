--In 7.sql, write a SQL query to list all movies released in 2010 and their ratings, in descending order by rating. For movies with the same rating, order them alphabetically by title.
--Your query should output a table with two columns, one for the title of each movie and one for the rating of each movie.
--Movies that do not have ratings should not be included in the result.

select title, rating from movies join ratings on movies.id = ratings.movie_id where year = 2010 order by rating desc, title;
